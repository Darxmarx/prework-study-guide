## Usage

The webpage features notes on four different topics that web developers often use, including HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. All four topics are divided into their own individual sections, preserved in a simple and effective format for easy studying. Additionally, by opening the DevTools console, a user may see the JavaScript running behind-the-scenes, representing the back-end development that will be further elaborated on during the course of the bootcamp's length. The console lists all 4 topics learned about during prework, and even randomly suggests a topic to study first.
